                    Casey Antony has born in March 19,1986 in Warren, Ohio as one of the two children of Cindry and George Anthony. Her dad has worked as a police officer but when we are at our case’s time he has already retired. Her mom was an assistant at a hospital.

                <p class="para" style="background-color:rgba(85, 85, 85, 0.015) ;">
                    According to her friends she was a bright, personable young girl but they thought also that she started lying big things too soon.

                    The next case will perfectly represent how things went in this family with all the lying and hiding things.

                    Back in time, in 2004 Casey dropped out of the highschool, one semester before her graduation, since she did not attend the classes. The parents found it out only 2 days before the graduation but instead of punishing her for dropping out and lying they faked the whole event in front of their family.

                <p class="para" style="background-color:rgba(85, 85, 85, 0.015) ;">
                    At that time Casey also had a boyfriend, Jesse, who proposed her a few months after the incident. The girl said yes to Jesse, but the man went to university almost immediately after the proposal. Since they were bridesmaids, they stayed in touch. At least for a while, because after a few months Casey has decided to break up with Jesse. That is the point when another lie is coming in the picture.
                </p>
                <p class="para" style="background-color:rgba(85, 85, 85, 0.015) ;">
                    It turned out, Casey was pregnant, but did not tell anyone, nor her parents. It was interesting for the entire family, because after eight monts of pregnancy it was obvious for everybody, but her mother denied it, even with her hospital experience. At that time Casey were 22 years old
                </p>
                <p class="para" style="background-color:rgba(85, 85, 85, 0.015) ;">
                    9 August, 2005 Caylee has born. Everybody said, she is very lovely, adorable, loving child who loved cartoons and playing outside. They also said, Casey is a perfect mother who spends all of her free time with her daughter, until 16 June, 2021…
